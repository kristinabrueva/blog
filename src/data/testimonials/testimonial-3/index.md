I worked closely with Igor in Hivetec. Over these years, he showed that he is hard-working, talented and independent CTO and can work on variety of tasks. He has proven to be an expert in Ruby/Rails and Kubernetes/DevOps areas and he is an active contributor in open-source community. His expertise was always meaningful and value to others, both as mentor and as a friend. I wish I had opportunity to meet more people like him.
